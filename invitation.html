      <h1>Dear Fighters, Coaches and Friends</h1>
      <p>I would like to invite you all to Yokso Dutch Open 2012 on Saturday 28th April.</p>
      <p>
        This year you have the opportunity to stay a bit longer and enjoy Queensday in 
        Amsterdam together with over 1 million people. We would be honoured to have you 
        here as guests in Amsterdam. Last year we got the advise to call it: "YDO: The 
        Friendly Tournament". That is exactly what we want to be. Come to Amsterdam and 
        enjoy this experience with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year the Grand Champion was Sean McCartney who beat Timmy Sarantoudis in the 
       Finals. Let's see what this year will bring.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to welcoming you at the Yokoso Dutch Open 2012, USH!
