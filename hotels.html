      <h1>Queensday</h1>
      <p>
        On the 30th of April over 1 million people are visiting Amsterdam. Queensday 
        started out as a freemarket, but nowadays it is one big party. No cars are 
        permitted in the center and everywhere radiostation have concerts. Start 
        partying @ the 29th at night and continue till the late hours of the 30th. 
        This is your chance to experience this amazing party.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are aware of the problems this event contributes to getting a hotel. Still 
        we have chosen this date, because we fighters are always paying for everything 
        and have many travel expenses. So why not combine it with Queensdag and have a 
        nice holiday? For this reason we urge you to book asap. If we can be of any help 
        send us an e-mail with your questions or give us a call.

      <h3>Cheap sleeping place</h3>
      <p>
        As previous years we've managed to rent a sportshall to make it possible to get
        a cheap sleepplace. Nothing fancy, but bunkbeds, a supermarket @ 100 meters, 
        the Event sportshall @ 300 meters, the tram @ 600 meters (15 minutes for the 
        center of Amsterdam) and low budget. From Friday 20:00 till Wednesday early 
        morning for &euro;55. This is for 1 to 5 days. It doesn't matter.
